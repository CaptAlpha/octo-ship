##  Overview of the Project

>An application that will check for vessels present in an image.
##  Significance of the Project

* Helps to accurately detect different type of vessels (Cargo, Tankers, Military, Carrier, Cruise)

* Trained the ML model with images of each type of vessel

* User Friendly web application.

## Technology used

* OpenCV
* TensorFlow
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Flask

##  Description

* Our application allows the drone user to detect, identify and classify the type of water vessels such as Cruise ship, Military Ship etc. 
* Our algorithm works with the help of Transfer Learning and uses Xception model to identify and classify the type of ships.
* Our software allows the drones to identify the vessels in the sunlight as well as in absence of light using image processing techniques such as 
dilation and median blur
